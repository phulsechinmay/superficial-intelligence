Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the most common modern forms are diesel and electric locomotives, the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. Other energy sources include horses, engine or water-driven rope or wire winch, gravity, pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines. Train tracks usually consist of two running rails, sometimes supplemented by additional rails such as electric conducting rails and rack rails, with a limited number of monorails and maglev guideways in the mix.

This started out as a once-a-year occurrence but later expanded to four times a year. In fact, plans to have CicLAvia once a month are in the works. While it may seem primarily intended for cyclists, many people can be seen skateboarding, running, or walking down the path. Each street that is closed off is attended by traffic, and police, officers who direct the cars to alternative routes through Los Angeles, and through the various car crossing points, and volunteers who assist participants with info or aid. On some streets the traffic lights are still in service, which means the bikers and pedestrians must abide by the traffic laws. LAPD Traffic Divisions and LADOT Parking Enforcement Traffic Officers are guarding each intersection to allow ultimate safety of the community during this event. CicLAvia brings together densely populated and diverse neighborhoods through a bike route.

The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.

Each street that is closed off is attended by traffic, and police, officers who direct the cars to alternative routes through Los Angeles, and through the various car crossing points, and volunteers who assist participants with info or aid. On some streets the traffic lights are still in service, which means the bikers and pedestrians must abide by the traffic laws. LAPD Traffic Divisions and LADOT Parking Enforcement Traffic Officers are guarding each intersection to allow ultimate safety of the community during this event.

Since the 1920s, the American film industry has grossed more money every year than that of any other country.","label":"Hollywood","categories":["Cinema of the United States","Industry in the United States"],"types":[],"alternateLabels":["Hollywood","American","Cinema of the United States","American film","Hollywood films"],"image":{"full":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/United_States_film.svg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/United_States_film.svg?width=300"},"lod":{"dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cinema_of_the_United_States","wikipedia":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cinema_of_the_United_States"}}]},{"id":"236841","comment":"I Agree","date":"Sep 19, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"236841","comment":"I Agree","date":"May 2, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"236841","comment":"Good for tourists.","date":"Apr 19, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[{"start":0,"end":4,"spot":"Good","confidence":0.6388,"id":580039,"title":"Goods","uri":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Goods","abstract":"In economics, goods are materials that satisfy human wants and provide utility, for example, to a consumer making a purchase of a satisfying product.

Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \"dog parks\", permit dogs to run off-leash.","label":"Park","categories":["Landscape","Parks","Protected areas","Recreation"],"types":[],"alternateLabels":["Park","Parks","Recreation ground","Public parks","Public park"],"image":{"full":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Veale_Gardens.JPG","thumbnail":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Veale_Gardens.JPG?width=300"},"lod":{"dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park","wikipedia":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park"}},{"start":54,"end":70,"spot":"residential area","confidence":0.6674,"id":543770,"title":"Residential area","uri":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Residential_area","abstract":"A residential area is a land use in which housing predominates, as opposed to industrial and commercial areas.","label":"Residential","categories":["Urban studies and planning terminology","Housing"],"types":[],"alternateLabels":["Residential","Residential area","Residential development","Residential building","Residential property"],"image":{"full":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/HelenaMT_II.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/HelenaMT_II.jpg?width=300"},"lod":{"dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Residential_area","wikipedia":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Residential_area"}}]},{"id":"236895","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jul 25, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"236895","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jun 8, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"236895","comment":"On Occidental or La Fayette Park Place between Beverly and Third St.  This is an extremely hi-density area, and might do very well in this location.","date":"Apr 16, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[{"start":17,"end":27,"spot":"La Fayette","confidence":0.6599,"id":156068,"title":"Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette","uri":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gilbert_du_Motier%2C_Marquis_de_Lafayette","abstract":"Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (6 September 1757 \u2013 20 May 1834), in the U.S. often known simply as Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War.

The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.

In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.

This started out as a once-a-year occurrence but later expanded to four times a year. In fact, plans to have CicLAvia once a month are in the works. While it may seem primarily intended for cyclists, many people can be seen skateboarding, running, or walking down the path. Each street that is closed off is attended by traffic, and police, officers who direct the cars to alternative routes through Los Angeles, and through the various car crossing points, and volunteers who assist participants with info or aid. On some streets the traffic lights are still in service, which means the bikers and pedestrians must abide by the traffic laws. LAPD Traffic Divisions and LADOT Parking Enforcement Traffic Officers are guarding each intersection to allow ultimate safety of the community during this event. CicLAvia brings together densely populated and diverse neighborhoods through a bike route. The event now attracts over 100,000 participants and expands to connect even more neighborhoods.","label":"CicLAvia","categories":["Cycling events in the United States","Sports in Los Angeles, California","Events in Los Angeles, California"],"types":[],"alternateLabels":["CicLAvia"],"image":{"full":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Iconic_Wilshire_CicLAvia.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Iconic_Wilshire_CicLAvia.jpg?width=300"},"lod":{"dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/CicLAvia","wikipedia":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CicLAvia"}}]},{"id":"237175","comment":"I Agree","date":"Apr 28, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237175","comment":"I Agree","date":"Apr 28, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237175","comment":"Would love to see one here!","date":"Apr 17, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237175","comment":"Great place for one!","date":"Apr 16, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237178","comment":"I Agree","date":"Aug 2, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237178","comment":"We need more bike share locations in residential areas so people can easily pick up a bike close to where they live.","date":"Jun 28, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[{"start":13,"end":23,"spot":"bike share","confidence":0.7563,"id":488682,"title":"Bicycle-sharing system","uri":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bicycle-sharing_system","abstract":"A bicycle-sharing system, public bicycle system, or bike-share scheme, is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a very short term basis.

For many systems, smartphone mapping apps show nearby stations with available bikes and open docks.","label":"Bicycle sharing system","categories":["Cycling infrastructure","Bicycle sharing","Articles containing video clips","Sharing economy"],"types":[],"alternateLabels":["Bicycle sharing system","Bike-sharing","Bike share","Community bicycle program","Bicycle sharing"],"image":{"full":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Hangzhou_bike_sharing_station.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Hangzhou_bike_sharing_station.jpg?width=300"},"lod":{"dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bicycle-sharing_system","wikipedia":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bicycle-sharing_system"}}]},{"id":"237207","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jul 25, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237207","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jul 21, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237207","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jul 19, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237208","comment":"I Agree","date":"May 1, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237208","comment":"Close to BoA and shopping!","date":"Apr 28, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237210","comment":"I Agree","date":"May 26, 2018","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237210","comment":"Ok ","date":"Apr 30, 2018","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237210","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jan 24, 2018","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237210","comment":"I Agree","date":"Aug 1, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237210","comment":"I Agree","date":"May 26, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237211","comment":"I Agree","date":"Sep 28, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237211","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jul 7, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237211","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jun 29, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237212","comment":"I Agree","date":"Oct 17, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237212","comment":"I Agree","date":"May 2, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237212","comment":"I Agree","date":"May 1, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237215","comment":"I Agree","date":"Mar 11, 2019","user":"Guest","annotations":[]},{"id":"237215","comment":"I Agree","date":"Sep 20, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237215","comment":"I Agree","date":"Apr 18, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237216","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jul 25, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237216","comment":"This location is perfect for me because I could ride TO this location for my errands or coffee.","date":"Apr 29, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[{"start":5,"end":13,"spot":"location","confidence":0.6234,"id":36808,"title":"Heart","uri":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heart","abstract":"The heart is a muscular organ in humans and other animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system.

In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \"dog parks\", permit dogs to run off-leash.","label":"Park","categories":["Landscape","Parks","Protected areas","Recreation"],"types":[],"alternateLabels":["Park","Parks","Recreation ground","Public parks","Public park"],"image":{"full":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Veale_Gardens.JPG","thumbnail":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/Special:FilePath\/Veale_Gardens.JPG?width=300"},"lod":{"dbpedia":"http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park","wikipedia":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Park"}}]},{"id":"237346","comment":"I Agree","date":"Jun 2, 2017","user":"Anonymous","annotations":[]},{"id":"237347","comment":"I Agree.

Each street that is closed off is attended by traffic, and police, officers who direct the cars to alternative routes through Los Angeles, and through the various car crossing points, and volunteers who assist participants with info or aid. On some streets the traffic lights are still in service, which means the bikers and pedestrians must abide by the traffic laws. LAPD Traffic Divisions and LADOT Parking Enforcement Traffic Officers are guarding each intersection to allow ultimate safety of the community during this event.

Each street that is closed off is attended by traffic, and police, officers who direct the cars to alternative routes through Los Angeles, and through the various car crossing points, and volunteers who assist participants with info or aid. On some streets the traffic lights are still in service, which means the bikers and pedestrians must abide by the traffic laws.

On some streets the traffic lights are still in service, which means the bikers and pedestrians must abide by the traffic laws.
