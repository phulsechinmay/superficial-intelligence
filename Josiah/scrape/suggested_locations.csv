Already a dense transit-oriented neighborhood, that density is set to increase dramatically, with the construction of several new transit-oriented housing developments in the area. 

The rate of rate of car ownership amongst households along Vermont Avenue is exceptionally low by LA standards, with as many 62% of Vermont Corridor households reportedly owning no car, a positive convergence of the areas several excellent transit options and severe lack of available parking.

Thusly, being located in a heavily populated and widely paved area, the Vermont/Beverly Metro Rail station would be serve as an excellent location for the placement of a new Metro Bike share station.
